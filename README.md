## Description

This repo is mainly used as an example how to use the QuantumBlochSphere component.

- ARCHITECTURE IDEA: The repo https://github.com/MaxieHelenBichmann/QuantumBlochSphere.git is only constructed as a package, that can be included in other projects like the WiQi.
The actual website to show the module is here in this repo, and includes the QuantumBlochSphere as a git submodule.
